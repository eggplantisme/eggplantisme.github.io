I made a website for see different spectral(Adjacent Matrix, Laplacian Matrix, Bethe Hessian Matrix...) of network generated by SBM model. Please see this website [Spectral Visual](http://eggplantisme.eu.pythonanywhere.com/spectral/) .

This is also my first time to use pythonanywhere, I will maintain this site for make other tool. Now only this spectral visualization is ok.
